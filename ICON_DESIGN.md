# MyKindOfDiary Icon Design Guide

## Concept
The app icon should represent the concept of personal journaling and privacy with a clean, modern design that works well at small sizes.

## Design Elements

### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: Deep black (#000000) - Represents privacy and the dark theme
- **Accent**: Neon blue/cyan (#0ea5e9) - Matches the app's accent color
- **Secondary**: Light gray/white (#ffffff) - For text/content elements

### Symbol Ideas
1. **Minimalist Pen & Notepad**:
   - A simple pen icon with a small notepad
   - Clean lines, no excessive detail
   - Pen tip in neon blue to match app accent color

2. **Abstract Journal**:
   - Stacked rectangles representing journal pages
   - Top page slightly offset to show layering
   - One corner folded to indicate a personal journal

3. **Minimalist "M"**:
   - Stylized "M" for "MyKindOfDiary"
   - Incorporate a small writing element
   - Clean geometric design

### Size Requirements
The icon needs to be provided in multiple sizes for different platforms:

#### Android
- mipmap-mdpi: 48x48 px
- mipmap-hdpi: 72x72 px
- mipmap-xhdpi: 96x96 px
- mipmap-xxhdpi: 144x144 px
- mipmap-xxxhdpi: 192x192 px

#### iOS
- 20x20 px (Notification)
- 29x29 px (Settings)
- 40x40 px (Spotlight)
- 60x60 px (App)
- 76x76 px (iPad)
- 83.5x83.5 px (iPad Pro)
- 1024x1024 px (App Store)

## Design Principles
1. **Simplicity**: Clean design that's recognizable at small sizes
2. **Contrast**: Good contrast between elements for visibility
3. **Consistency**: Match the app's dark theme with neon accents
4. **Scalability**: Design should work well when scaled down to 20x20 px

## Implementation Notes
- Keep details minimal for small size recognition
- Use solid colors rather than gradients for better scalability
- Ensure the icon looks good on both dark and light backgrounds
- Consider how the icon will look in the app launcher among other apps
